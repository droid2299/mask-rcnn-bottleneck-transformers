# Mask-RCNN using Bottleneck Transformers

This is our attempt to reproduce the metrics of image segementation given in the paper "Bottleneck Transformers for Visual Recognition" by Srinivas et.al.


To train the model on the COCO dataset, just run

```
python train.py
```

To run inference on a video, run

```
python inference.py
```

TODO:
1. Make code more modular
